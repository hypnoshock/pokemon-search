This project provides a REST api to allow users to search for pokemon.
Pokemon can be searched by:

`/pokemon` (retrieves all pokemon ordered by ID)
`/pokemon/:id` (retrieves a single pokemon by ID)
`/pokemon/:name` (retrieves a single pokemon by name)

### Query Parameters Pattern

For filtering by ranges, use suffix patterns:

{stat}\_min - minimum value (inclusive)
{stat}\_max - maximum value (inclusive)
price_min - minimum value (inclusive)
price_max - maximum value (inclusive)
bst_min - minimum value (inclusive)
bst_max - maximum value (inclusive)

For sorting:

sort - the stat field to sort by
order - either asc or desc (default to asc if omitted)
