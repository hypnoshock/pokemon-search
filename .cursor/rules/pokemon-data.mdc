The data for each of the 1025 pokemon is found in `data/pokemon` as a set of individual .json files named by id. They are all loaded upfront during initialisation phase and stored as objects keyed by ID in a map within `controller/pokemon.ts`

Each of the .json files contain superfluous data so each of the stored pokemon objects contain only a subset of this data:

```
id (number)
name (string)
sprites.other.official-artwork.front_default (string)
stats (array of stat objects)
types (array of type objects)

```

### example of stat object

```
{
  "base_stat": 45,
  "effort": 0,
  "stat": {
    "name": "hp",
    "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/1/"
  }
}
```

### example of type object

```
{
  "slot": 1,
  "type": {
    "name": "grass",
    "url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/12/"
  }
}
```

## Pokemon schema

The data served up over the REST api for each of the pokemon is a union of the data stored in the pokemon map (found in the pokemon.ts controller with data derived from the pokemon .json files), the price of the pokemon (`pokemon-prices.json`) and a pre-calculated BST rating

```
const pokemonSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    id: { type: 'number' },
    name: { type: 'string' },
    image: { type: 'string' },
    stats: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        hp: { type: 'number' },
        attack: { type: 'number' },
        defense: { type: 'number' },
        'special-attack': { type: 'number' },
        'special-defense': { type: 'number' }
      }
    },
    bst: { type: 'number' },
    price: { type: 'number' }
  }
};

```
